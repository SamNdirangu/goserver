# Fiber API Server with SQL

This is a fiber server couples with an mysql database using gorm
This project is similar in form to my earlier nodeJS server powered with mongoose and written in typescript. However this now uses a MySQL database.

You can check out the earlier project built with typescript and express here https://github.com/SamNdirangu/nodets
